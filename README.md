This dataset includes all links within the Bergen municipality collected from the NVDB database provided by Statens vegvesen (Norwegian Public Roads Administration) and contains data under the Norwegian licence for Open Government Data (NLOD) distributed by Statens vegvesen. Where it applies, links were matched with speed limits, height restrictions, roadblocks and turn restrictions (also acquired from NVDB). Numerous errors in the data were corrected according to the actual state.
